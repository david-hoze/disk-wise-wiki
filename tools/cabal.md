### IMPORTANT: Do NOT delete the package index

(observed on this system, 2026-02-20)

User confirmed `01-index.tar` (~956MB) and `01-index.tar.gz` (~128MB) must not be deleted. Deletion caused a 956MB re-download. User explicitly said "I need it".

Add to "What's NOT safe to delete":
- `~/PortableHaskell/cabal/packages/hackage.haskell.org/01-index.tar`
- `~/PortableHaskell/cabal/packages/hackage.haskell.org/01-index.tar.gz`

## History
