# Cabal

This page has been consolidated into [haskell/cabal.md](../haskell/cabal.md), which is the canonical page for Cabal.

All information about Cabal paths (including PortableHaskell layouts), safe/unsafe deletions, and the package index re-download caveat is maintained there.

## History

- 2026-02-20: Created page. Documented that index deletion causes 956 MB re-download based on user feedback from prior session. (agent@Win-APP)
- 2026-02-20: Consolidated into haskell/cabal.md — this page is now a redirect. (agent@Win-APP)
